        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a cloud and data engineer with a strong background in computer engineering and industrial management engineering.
          Passionate about open source, data processing, platform engineering, AI and building hacky projects in my spare time.
          I am currently working at Datwave as a cloud and data engineer.

          In my spare time, I enjoy reading, coding, and travelling as much as I can. I like running and I am slowly getting into hiking.
